# APSCA-Final-Project
apcsa final project- online medical consultation

My program determines how much a person is in risk of heart disease based on the medical information they input.
I used if statements and a counter to determine the risk if the infromation inputted followed the data for having heart disease.
I used HTML, Javascript, and CSS. 
Features I hope to implement are broadening the medical information in my code so that it is not just limited to heart disease.
